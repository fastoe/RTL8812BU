### Updating the drivers
**NOTE: this has only been tested as working with kernel 5.11 and above so far**

You will need to re-install Wifi drivers after each *kernel update*.

After updating your kernel, when asked if you would like to restart now, click "No".

Then, navigate to this project's directory (or `git clone` the appropriate branch)

Finally, run this command:
`sudo bash ./update.sh`

If you have already rebooted, you will need to run the previous command TWICE so that way you can get the most up-to-date drivers as some commands require internet access.


### For kernel 5.11 or later, please clone the v5.13.1 branch:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms git bc
git clone -b v5.13.1 https://github.com/fastoe/RTL8812BU.git
cd RTL8812BU
make
sudo make install
sudo reboot
```

### For 5.10 kernel, please clone the v5.6.1 branch:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms git bc
git clone -b v5.6.1 https://github.com/fastoe/RTL8812BU.git
cd RTL8812BU
make
sudo make install
sudo reboot
```

### For 5.9 and previous versions:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms git bc
git clone https://github.com/fastoe/RTL8812BU.git
cd RTL8812BU
make
sudo make install
sudo reboot
```

For setting monitor mode:

```bash
# configure for monitor mode
sed -i 's/CONFIG_80211W = n/CONFIG_80211W = y/' Makefile
sed -i 's/CONFIG_WIFI_MONITOR = n/CONFIG_WIFI_MONITOR = y/' Makefile

make
sudo make install
sudo ip link set wlx1cbfcea97791 down
sudo iw wlx1cbfcea97791 set monitor none
sudo ip link set wlx1cbfcea97791 up
```
